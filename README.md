# 🎮 Unity Game Fair – Portfolio Project

This Unity project is a **game hub** that collects multiple mini-games developed as exercises during my study course. Each exercise is structured as a standalone “fair game” that the player can select and play within a shared environment.

The goal is to build a growing collection of small, focused gameplay experiences while demonstrating clean project structure and solid Unity development practices.

## Current Mini-Game

- **Target Practice** – A skill-based shooting game focused on aiming accuracy, timing, and responsive feedback.

This repository serves as a portfolio project showcasing my proficiency in Unity, C#, and gameplay programming.
